"""Static check: forbid trailing-slash ``/api/...`` URL literals in frontend code.

Why this exists
---------------
Counterpart to ``scripts/check_api_trailing_slash.py``. The backend script
forbids declaring trailing-slash routes; this one forbids calling them.

If frontend code does ``fetch('/api/foo/')`` while the backend route is
``/api/foo``, FastAPI/Starlette 307-redirects to the no-slash form with an
**absolute** ``Location`` built from the request ``Host``. Behind a reverse
proxy that doesn't preserve ``Host`` (or with ``proxy_headers`` off, i.e.
``NEKO_BEHIND_PROXY != 1``), that absolute URL points at the internal
``127.0.0.1:<port>`` and the browser dies with ``ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED``.
PR #938 (chara_manager regression on LAN reverse proxies) was exactly this
bug. See ``.agent/rules/neko-guide.md`` (§"API URL 末尾不带斜杠" — "no trailing slash on API URLs") and
``main_routers/characters_router.py`` docstring for the full write-up.

What it flags
-------------
String literals like ``'/api/...'``, ``"/api/..."``, ```/api/...``` whose
last character before the closing quote is ``/``. Quote types covered:
single, double, backtick.

What it does NOT flag (intentional)
-----------------------------------
* **Prefix builders** — a ``/api/...`` literal whose closing quote is
  immediately followed by a string-concat continuation (``+``, template
  ``${`` interpolation closing brace, etc.). Example:
  ``'/api/characters/catgirl/' + encodeURIComponent(name)`` is fine — the
  trailing ``/`` is a path separator before an appended segment, the final
  URL still has no trailing slash.
* **The ``/api/`` prefix alone** — too short to be a real endpoint, very
  likely a base-URL constant that gets things appended.

The detection is a regex check rather than a JS parser to keep CI fast and
zero-dep. Edge cases (e.g. a literal that's stored in a variable and only
*sometimes* concatenated) will produce false negatives, which is the
acceptable failure mode — we'd rather miss an exotic dynamic call than flag
every prefix-builder.

Scope
-----
Default: ``static/``, ``frontend/``, ``templates/``. Pass paths explicitly
to scan elsewhere.

Suppression
-----------
Add ``// noqa: API_TRAILING_SLASH`` on the same line for JS/TS or
``<!-- noqa: API_TRAILING_SLASH -->`` for HTML if you genuinely need the
trailing slash (e.g. you're calling a third-party API that requires it).

Output
------
Every violation prints as ``path:line:col  API_TRAILING_SLASH  message``.
Exit status is 1 when any violation is found, 0 otherwise.

# Match an ``/api/...`` string literal. Three quote variants. We capture
# the path part separately from any optional ``?query`` / ``#fragment``
# tail so the violation check can ask "did the URL PATH end with '/'?",
# which is the right question — Starlette's 307 fires on path-vs-route
# mismatch, query string is irrelevant. Reported by Codex on PR #1082:
# the previous regex hard-coded ``/<close-quote>`` and silently missed
# ``fetch('/api/foo/?x=1')`` even though it still 307s.
#
# Char-class rationale: anything except the matching quote (terminates the
# literal), whitespace (terminates an unquoted token), and — for urlpath
# only — ``?`` and ``#`` (those mark the start of the qf tail). ``+`` is
# DELIBERATELY allowed in both: it's a valid URL byte (the form-encoded
# space, very common in query strings — second Codex finding on PR #1082).
# The string-concat detection happens post-quote via ``_NEXT_TOKEN_RE`` so
# we don't need to exclude ``+`` from the literal's char class to spot
# prefix builders.
# Slash IS allowed in path so multi-segment URLs match. Require at least
# one char after ``/api/`` to rule out the bare prefix.
